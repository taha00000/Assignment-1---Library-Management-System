Summary of Edge Cases Resolved and Tests Added

This document summarizes the validation improvements and new test cases added to the Library Management System application.

=================================
I. Resolved Edge Cases
=================================

The following edge cases are now handled to prevent invalid data and ensure data integrity.

---
1. Author Management
---
  - Duplicate Names: The system now prevents adding a new author or updating an existing author to have a name that already exists in the database.
  - Invalid Names: The 'Name' field for an author is now required and cannot be empty. It is also limited to a maximum length of 100 characters.

---
2. Book Management
---
  - Duplicate ISBNs: The system now prevents adding a new book or updating an existing book to have an ISBN that already exists in the database.
  - Invalid Data: The 'Title' and 'ISBN' fields for a book are now required and cannot be empty. The Title is limited to 200 characters, and the ISBN must be between 10 and 20 characters.

---
3. Member Management
---
  - Duplicate Names: The system now prevents adding a new member or updating an existing member to have a name that already exists in the database.
  - Invalid Names: The 'Name' field for a member is now required and cannot be empty. It is also limited to a maximum length of 100 characters.


=================================

---
  - Add_ShouldReturnView_WhenISBNIsDuplicate:
      Ensures the application shows an error when trying to add a book with an ISBN that is already in use.

      Ensures the application shows an error when trying to update a book's ISBN to one that is already in use by another book.

---
3. Tests for MembersController (in MembersControllerTest.cs)
---
  - Add_ShouldReturnView_WhenMemberNameIsDuplicate:
      Ensures the application shows an error when trying to add a member with a name that is already in use.
